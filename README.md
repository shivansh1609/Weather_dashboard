1. Project Title / Headline

ClimaView: Real-Time Weather & Air Quality Dashboard
An interactive, data-powered visualization tool designed to provide real-time and historical insights on weather conditions, forecasts, and air quality across multiple cities.

2. Short Description / Purpose

The ClimaView Dashboard is a visually engaging Power BI project enhanced with API integration to showcase live updates.
It allows users to:

🌡️ Track temperature, humidity, visibility, and wind speed

☀️ Monitor sunrise and sunset times

📈 Compare weekly forecasts

🌍 Analyze Air Quality Index (AQI) across pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, CO, NO2, SO2, O3)

🌧️ Check precipitation and probability of rainfall

This tool is designed for data analysts, weather enthusiasts, and decision-makers who want to explore weather trends with clarity and precision.

3. Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

📊 Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization platform for building the dashboard

🔄 Power Query – For data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL)

🧮 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – For calculated measures, trends, and conditional logic

🌐 Kaggle Datasets – Used for historical weather and climate data

☁️ OpenWeatherMap API – Integrated to fetch real-time weather updates

📂 Excel/CSV – For initial dataset cleaning and structure

4. Features

📊 Real-time weather metrics (temperature, humidity, visibility, pressure, wind speed)

🕒 Sunrise & Sunset visualizations

📈 Forecast charts for upcoming days

🌫️ Air Quality Index with pollutant breakdown (PM10, PM2.5, CO, NO2, SO2, O3)

🌧️ Probability of rain with easy-to-read visuals

🌍 Compare multiple cities dynamically
